Two parts to each page - script and xaml file.
use EditText editText1 = FindViewById<EditText>(Resource.Id.editText1);
to access any element, where Resource.Id.x is the id of that element

use this to change pages, where EventsPageActivity can be replaced by the script of the page you want to laod
authenticateButton.Click += (sender, e) =>
{
                var intent = new Intent(this, typeof(EventsPageActivity));
                StartActivity(intent);
};

make sure you have SetContentView(Resource.Layout.x) under base.OnCreate of a script
where x is the name of the xaml file for that script
