# HackMatch
Find your teammate for a hackathon

This app will allow you to show your technologies, hackathon interest and experience. You can use this to find teammates who you think you will work well with, or to just chat about your passions and your ideas. It uses a fun, gamified approach to allow you to build your team in advance, meet great, technologically-minded people and have a much better experience at hackathons.

This was done in C#, using Xamarin, for Android.

Built during HackUPC 2017
